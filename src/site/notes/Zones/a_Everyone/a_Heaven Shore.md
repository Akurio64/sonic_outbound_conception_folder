Heaven Shore is a beach/jungle/mountain hybrid zone with Greek-like structuring everywhere. Its buildings are a true mystery, those existing since millenniums while still in great condition. Legends say it used to be home to aliens. Heaven Shore for Sonic is built around speed.

Act 1: Sonic will pass through beach sections and jungle sections in this act.

Act 2: The sun starting to set, the mountain biome is also introduced.
