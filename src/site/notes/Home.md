**Sonic Outbound** is, above all, for people wanting a second dose of Sonic Mania while being entirely original in its concepts and complexion. It features 12 zones, with 8 of them being original and 4 being reimagined past zones, an inverted ratio from what Sonic Mania had. The storyâ€™s progression is split for the 3 main characters (Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles) and ends with the same final zone
