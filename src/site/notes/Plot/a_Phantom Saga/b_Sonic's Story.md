# Sonic' story

## Heaven Shore:

- Sonic’s goal is to find the Time Stones by travelling to the past (Robotnik is too strong to collect them by normal means). There, he would be able to find a Giant Ring giving him access to the Time Stone special stage.
- Sonic starts by going to Heaven Shore, destroying badniks and doing cool stuff. As he gets to the end of the first Act, he starts running on the sea and meets the first miniboss, a shark Badnik. After defeating it, Sonic gets to Act 2.
- The sun is falling. Sonic continues his journey until he is met with Robotnik throwing a bomb where he stands, making him fall onto the arena of the Robotnik boss fight.
- After the boss fight, Sonic receives a call from Tails warning him of a bounty hunter working for Robotnik that is coming his way. Before Sonic could ask more questions, he is met by Fang who tries to surprise-attack Sonic with one of his bombs, but Sonic could (of course) react fast enough and avoid the attack. Fang then leaves, but Sonic follows him. They were going to Sunset Park.

## Sunset Park:

- After the first act, Sonic is met by Marve-Shupopolous-Gou, and the fight leads him to the reconstructed area of Sunset Park.
- Sonic goes on a train and finds Fang sleeping in the first wagon. Fang wakes up and starts fighting. After the battle, Fang gets a call from Robotnik that the ambush was successful and he can switch places with him. Sonic is confused, but decides to stay on the train to get to the next destination, Star Light Zone.

## Star Light:

- The miniboss is a movable, Red-Eye-like robot. After defeating the miniboss, Sonic passes through a tunnel that leads him to Act 2.
- At Act 2, Sonic gets to the top of the level, and takes a look at the city view. Suddenly, a swarm of star-shaped objects fly around Sonic while they darken everything outside of himself, leaving him in a closed off arena while Robotnik reveals himself in the Egg Ristar.
- At the end of the boss fight, Sonic has trouble deciding on where to go next, but then, Robotnik reactivates his machine and attacks Sonic from his back with such a huge blow it instantly knocks Sonic off.

## Nevertower:

- Sonic wakes up in a prison cell. He tries to get out with no success, until he sees Tails walk around the area. Tails then hacks the security system to let Sonic leave. They will now try to get out of the underground of Nevertower, by hacking through the firewall and getting to the top of the tower.
- The firewall starts using countermeasures to defend against Sonic and Tails, and after the fight, the former is breached and Sonic and Tails can get to the main stage. Sonic and Tails then meet up with Knuckles and they get to the top together.
- On top of the tower, Little Planet is chained. They meet Robotnik in his Thundermobile, in the company of Fang and Meta. The latter two fall off the arena when defeated.
- After the fight, Robotnik is ejected from the vehicle, however he had activated an autodestruction sequence. Meta grabs Robotnik and Fang then flies to Little Planet. The three protagonists figured they should follow them.

## Robotropolis:

- Sonic notices activity far away as soon as he lands on Little Planet, and discovers a huge city built there. Guessing this is where Robotnik is, he rushed to the middle of the city.
- The miniboss is a helicopter chasing Sonic through skyscrapers. After it is destroyed, Sonic enters the industrial area of the city.
- The final boss for Sonic’ story is Metal Robotnik. The fight will be on a bridge mainly. Sonic finds plans for the Egg Behemoth and Tails, in the Tornado, gets to him so that they can find Knuckles, (he was saved by Tails as he was falling down the sky). The three go to the Egg Behemoth.
