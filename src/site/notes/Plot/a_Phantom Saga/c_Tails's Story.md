# Tails's story
## Heaven Shore:

- Tails’ goal is to find the Chaos Emeralds by travelling to the past. (Robotnik is too strong to collect them by normal means) There, he would be able to find a Subspace Ring giving access to the Chaos Emerald special stage
- Tails goes through Act 1 then meets the first miniboss hidden in trees, Mecha-Gorilla. After defeating it, Tails enters the jungle biome of Act 2 while the sun falls.
- Tails notices a canine-like Mobian wearing a hat with a bunch of Chaos Emeralds that he throws into a portal. Tails confronts him, starting the first boss fight with Fang. 
- After Fang’s defeat, both notice Sonic and Robotnik being done with their fight, so Fang uses the Marvelous Queen to fly to Sonic. Tails tries to catch him with the Tornado, but Robotnik escapes and Tails sees Sonic chasing Fang, so he does the same for Robotnik.

## Launch Base:

- Tails loses Robotnik and lands on the abandoned section of Launch Base. The miniboss is an autonomous amalgamation of badniks.
- Tails enters the reactivated section with Robotnik controlling it. The boss is the Egg Drillster MKIII, which is much faster. The second phase is the vehicle and Tails fighting while falling down the sky. 
- After the fight, they fall underwater. Tails chases Robotnik in the entrance of Subnautic Station, but Robotnik, knowing the place like the back of his hand, manages to get away from Tails and calls Fang to let him know the ambush was successful.

## Subnautic Station:

- Tails uses the Sea Fox to travel through the incomplete section of Subnautic Station. The miniboss has not yet been designed.
- Tails finds Fang in the middle of Subnautic and chases him with the Subnautic Station. After that, Tails finds an exit to Subnautic Station which leads him to Techno Turret.

## Nevertower:

- Tails walks around the area until he sees Sonic trying to get out of a prison cell. Tails then hacks the security system to let Sonic leave. They will now try to get out the underground of Nevertower, by hacking through the firewall and getting to the top of the tower.
- The firewall starts using countermeasures to defend against Sonic and Tails. After the fight, the firewall is breached and Sonic and Tails can get to the main stage. Sonic and Tails then meet up with Knuckles and they get to the top together.
- On top of the tower, Little Planet is chained. They meet Robotnik in his Thundermobile, in the company of Fang and Meta. The latter two fall off the arena when they get defeated.
- After the fight, Robotnik is ejected from the vehicle, however he activates an autodestruction sequence. Meta grabsRobotnik and Fang and then flies to Little Planet. The three protagonists figured they should follow them.

## Erebopolis:

- Tails follows Fang and gets to the outskirts of the Egg Behemoth’s launch base (unaware of it). While advancing through the area, Tails’s miniboss will be E-010 Proto (the first step to the E-100 series) commanding a few other Eggrobos.
- Tails enters an elevator and when the elevator opens, he is shocked by the enormous airship waiting to be launched. He decides to destroy it before it’s too late.
- Fang tries to prevent Tails from stopping the Egg Behemoth from launching. Fang clicks the remote button to launch the Egg Behemoth as soon as Tails gets there, he then reveals his Marvelous Queen’s new update and flies off. Tails gets the Tornado and the two have a final showdown in a thunderous sky, with the Egg Behemoth flying off. After defeating Fang, Tails flies off to Sonic’s location to bring him on, then flies off to get Knuckles, who was saved by Tails as he was falling down the sky. The three go to the Egg Behemoth.
