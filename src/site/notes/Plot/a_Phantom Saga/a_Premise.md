# Premise

Sonic Outbound is set 1 year after Sonic Mania’s bad ending, where Robotnik had all Chaos Emeralds and the Phantom Ruby in possession. 

After the climatic battle against the Phantom Egg during the autodestruction of the Titanic Monarch, Sonic and Tails escaped with Knuckles’ help, thinking the Phantom Ruby and Robotnik were done for. Robotnik survived and since he was going to be stuck in Little Planet for a year, he took the occasion to prepare his greatest plan yet, starting by collecting the Time Stones.

In the present time, Sonic and Tails are relaxing on Heaven Shore, a pleasant beach in South Island that Sonic tends to chill on. Robotnik confronts Sonic, but as soon as Sonic riposts, he is hit by an unknown creature. This creature was Meta, a cybernetic fennec fox who works for Robotnik with the Master Emerald at her possession. At the same time, Knuckles falls from the sky. He was chasing Meta all the way to South Island. Robotnik decides to threaten Sonic by stating he has the Phantom Ruby, Chaos Emeralds, and Time Stones in his possession, then leaves. Because of the scope of the problem, the three decide to separate tasks to defeat Robotnik efficiently.
