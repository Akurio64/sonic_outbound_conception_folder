# Last Story

## Egg Behemoth:

- The three, on the Tornado, start infiltrating the Egg Fleet following the Egg Behemoth. The miniboss is the Egg Behemoth’s laser defense system. After destroying it, the three can enter the Egg Behemoth itself
- The three will go around and destroy all the reactor cores, and then get to the final one. After it is destroyed, Knuckles says goodbye to the 2 and jumps off Egg Behemoth, then suddenly, a second iteration of the Big Arms takes Sonic by the arms and slams him to the wall. This is a fight against time, as the Egg Behemoth will crash in only a few minutes. After this fight, the Egg Behemoth crashes, but unfortunately, it crashes to its planned destination.

## Final Battle:

- The Egg Behemoth had crashed into the ruins of Titanic Monarch. Robotnik laughs maniacally and goes far away underground. The ground shakes, as the Titanic Monarch robot crawls out of its hiding space.
- Phase 1: Sonic has to survive the attacks of the Titanic Monarch while Tails repairs the Tornado.
- Phase 2: Both fly on the Tornado to approach the Titanic Monarch and survive a bullet hell. 3D camera
- Phase 3: Sonic and Tails have approached the Titanic Monarch enough to be able to touch it. It will return to a normal perspective and will be a fusion of Sonic running on the Titanic Monarch’s body and being on the Tornado. They have to destroy the cannon and approach the head.
- Phase 4: If at least one Time Stone remains, Robotnik will use it as soon as Sonic enters the defense. Eventually, Sonic would lose because the Titanic Monarch is extremely compatible with the Time Stones and the bad ending will play out; if all Time Stones have been collected, then the defense will be basic technological attacks, before Phase 5.
- Phase 5: The core of the Titanic Monarch. As Sonic is inside the center of the Phantom Ruby’s highest showcase of power ever seen, Robotnik can essentially come up with any attack he wants. I don’t think I can put into words all the chaotic shit he is gonna do, but he is hittable, and eventually, he will be defeated.
- Ending???: The Titanic Monarch is self-destructing. If no Chaos Emeralds have been collected, then Sonic and Tails will leave without worrying about Robotnik, this triggers the bad ending, but later in the credits. 

## Bad Ending:

- If it was played at the end of Phase 4: Robotnik laughs as he sees Sonic and Tails defeated, and then uses the stones to open a time rift, and the Phantom Egg MKII gets out. He puts the stones into it and then Robotnik is able to use the machine to rewrite time, making it so Sonic and his friends are never born.
- If it was played at the end of Phase 5: Sonic and Tails return to South Island and meet up with Knuckles, Amy, Mighty, and Ray. The ending makes you believe everything is fine. The true credits even play until it’s suddenly interrupted. Robotnik had survived the Titanic Monarch’s self-destruction, and since he still has the Chaos Emeralds and the Phantom Ruby, he rebuilds the Egg Behemoth, the Titanic Monarch, and moves to Earth. Team Sonic, unable to fight off the entire restored Robotnik Empire at its peak, suffers an unknown fate as Robotnik takes over the entire world.

## True Final Boss:

- After Phase 5, Sonic will get out the Chaos Emeralds to end Robotnik once and for all, but the Chaos Emeralds react horribly with the Phantom Ruby at unstable power and the Time Stones. This causes a time rift sucking the three into it.
- They found themselves in the time void. The gems scatter all around the time void. Robotnik activates the Phantom Egg MKII to go search for the stones.
- Sonic and Tails will have to go search for the Chaos Emeralds to fight Robotnik. When they have the 7 Chaos Emeralds, Robotnik shows himself with the 7 Time Stones, and the final showdown commences.
- The fight is separated into 2 sections. 1: Sonic and Tails chases the Phantom Egg MK II, in a rocket form, as it runs around the time void, it will also summon Egg Fleets from the past (during Egg Behemoth Zone). When Sonic and Tails approach, they can hit the cockpit, causing Robotnik to transform into a mech form. It opens a portal to a random zone and starts using Time Stone attacks (7 different attacks for the 7 stones). Sonic and Tails have to hit the boss when they have the chance 3 times to remove one stone. For each stone removed, the cycle continues until the last stone has been removed.
- This is the final phase, Robotnik is desperate and uses the Phantom Ruby, despite him knowing how incompatible the Phantom Egg MKII is with it. The Phantom Egg MKII launches crazy attacks as it self-destructs (survival boss fight). Eventually, it collapses and Sonic takes the Phantom Ruby. He opens a rift to return to his world and leaves Robotnik in the time rift.

## True Ending:

- Sonic and Tails return to the South Island and meet up with Knuckles, Amy, Mighty, and Ray. After the credits play, Meta is shown to be on the ground after falling from it. E-010 Proto finds Meta collapsed and detects a life signal, so he takes her body to try to save her. This is a teaser for the Meta Saga, where her backstory is revealed and the Outbound story completely transitions to Sonic Adventure.
