# Knuckles's Story

## Heaven Shore:

- Knuckles’ goal is to get the Master Emerald back from Meta. He doesn’t have a special stage, and it’s uncertain if we will show past versions of the zones.
- Knuckles explores the cave of Heaven Shore and then meets up with the miniboss, a Mecha-Spider, who climbs on an arena alongside Knuckles.
- After its defeat, Knuckles finds an exit to the cave and continues to search for Meta. He eventually finds her waiting for him, as she was planning to end him this instant. After Meta’s defeat, she leaves to Relic Ruins, and Knuckles follows her.

## Relic Ruins:

- Knuckles does stuff in Relic Ruins, sorry for not having ideas for this zone.
- Meta boss fight.
- Relic Ruins, an ancient temple, has a Teleporter that brings Knuckles to Ice Cap (maybe)

## Ice Cap:

- Knuckles does his stuff in Act 1. The miniboss has not been designed.
- Knuckles notices a swarm of Egg-Copters flying around Ice Cap. He has to find Meta to stop this craziness. The two start fighting normally on top of the mountain, but then they start skiing down the mountain. 
- After Meta’s defeat, she makes the Egg-Copters retreat. Knuckles sneakily gets inside one of the Egg Copters to get to their destination. He is found before they get to Nevertower, so he was kicked down to Neverlake.

## Nevertower:

- Act 1 will be a Neverlake zone where Knuckles approaches the lake to get to the tower. The miniboss has not been designed. He then meets Sonic and Tails and they go together to the top.
- On top of the tower, Little Planet is chained. They meet Robotnik in his Thundermobile, in the company of Fang and Meta. Fang and Meta fall off the arena when they get defeated.
- After the fight, Robotnik is ejected from the mobile, but he activates an autodestruction sequence before. Meta grabs Robotnik and Fang and then flies to Little Planet. The three protagonists decided they should follow them and so they did.

## Stratopolis:

- Knuckles follows Meta and finds the floating continent of Little Planet. He enters Stratopolis because Meta mysteriously entered the city for no apparent reason. The miniboss has not been designed.
- Meta’s turmoil makes the Master Emerald go crazy. It caused a green storm and everything is in shackles on the floating continent. When Knuckles meets Meta, they have a showdown, and when Meta loses, she decides she must sacrifice herself to end these monsters. She goes Super, and that damages her. After a survival boss fight, Meta loses consciousness and falls from the sky. Knuckles gets the Master Emerald, but the arena they were fighting in completely breaks off and Knuckles falls to his doom. Good thing Tails saved him. They go to the Egg Behemoth now.
