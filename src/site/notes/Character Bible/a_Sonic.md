Sonic’s Outbound design is a mix of the classic and modern, as he is a year older than he was in Mania. He has the dreamcast color palette, a smaller belly (still round), leaving more room to his legs. He is 2 pixels taller, his eyes are brown like Sonic Origins’ cutscenes would show, his shoes are less pointy and more round, basically his Sonic Adventure 1 shoe design

**Backstory:**

Sonic was born in Christmas Island after it was nuked by Chaos energy during the Great War. This gave him physical prowess and extreme potency with the Chaos Emeralds, explaining why he has the most efficient Super form, with Shadow, who was created by Chaos energy. Sonic is the son of Jules The Hedgehog, one of the victims of the blast. His brother injected him with Project Shadow’s genome to see if he would gain power. Since Jules had no Chaos potency, it did not do anything, but the genome was inherited by Sonic, explaining why he has such a huge potency with Chaos energy.
