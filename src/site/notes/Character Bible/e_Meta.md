Meta is a 14 years old cybernetic fennec fox. She has a bunch of fighting experience and strength naturally, but her cybernetic enhancements make her able to stand against monsters of physical and Chaos prowess such as Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles. According to her, Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles are sadistic psychopathic threats to all the galaxy and she has to stop them, she calls them “the Triple Trouble”. None of them know where she heard that.

**Backstory revealed in the Meta Saga:**

Meta is a member of the Eternal Clan. The Eternal Clan are the remains of the native Little Planet Mobian civilization. Millennials ago, the Mobian civilization thrived because of them mastering the Time Stones, but an unknown civil war suddenly surged and ended them all. Most of the surviving Mobians emigrated to Earth. The chaos after this war made the remaining Mobians on Little Planet lose almost all documentation and knowledge they had, making them return to tribalism.

Meta was born in one of their villages, and she showed talent and wits ever since she was a child. She became the leader of their tribe at 12. This was around the same time as the events of Sonic CD. After seeing outsiders meddle with their stones, Meta decided they should collect them quickly and hide them before something else like that happened. 

1 year later, after the events of Sonic Mania, Robotnik found the Time Stones in Meta’s village, and tried to take them by force. He obviously won against all of the clan, but as he saw potential in Meta, he knocked her unconscious and brought her to his base. Robotnik erased her memories completely, only keeping muscle memory etc. He came up with a story telling Meta that she is the last remaining member of the galactic people known as the Eternals, whose life goal is to end the Triple Troubles, Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles, three planetary threats. He said to Meta that she is not gonna be able to beat them in her current state, and that she needs enhancement. She accepted and this is how she became a cyborg.
