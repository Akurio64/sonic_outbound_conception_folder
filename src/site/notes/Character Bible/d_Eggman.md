Robotnik has a design that makes him resemble modern Robotnik a bit more. I will try to find the design I made for him because I cannot find it. We have this sprite though. Basically, it’s a modern outfit but simpler with some classic aspects.

**Backstory:**

Robotnik used to be known as Ovi Kintobor. He was a well-known inventor in the human world, but during the Great War, he grew disgusted with humanity and defected to the Mobian side.

**Great War:**

The human world used to barely interact with Mobians, mainly because the Battle Kukku Empire fended off humans during the Colonial Age. Decades ago, a huge human war began due to political tensions. This war eventually involved Mobians when multiple human factions started invading Mobian islands to get their Chaos Emeralds. At that moment, the humans had the advantage, but Kintobor, outraged by the acts of humans, defected to defend the Mobians with his technological knowledge and intellect. Thanks to him, the Mobians pushed back the humans and won. Unfortunately the United Federation had collected 1 Chaos Emerald before and had created a Chaos Nuke. They sent it to Christmas Island to instill fear in the Mobians, and ever since, most of the Christmas Islanders were affected by it.

To heal the victims of the Chaos Nuke, Kintobor worked with Charles the Hedgehog to build a Roboticizer which would heal the victims. Although, seeing the potential of the Roboticizer, Kintobor tried getting Charles to realise how powerful this invention is, but unable to get this into Charles’ mind, Kintobor eventually killed him, changed his identity, and left Christmas Island. Ever since, he realised that only he is reliable and this is why he should rule over the world.
