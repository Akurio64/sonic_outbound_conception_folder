Knuckles also did not change much. His super form design is basically light pink with elevated hair.

**Backstory:**

The Knuckles Clan have hereditary Chaos potency because of how close they are with the Master Emerald. When Knuckles was but a kid, his clan was still composed of a few members. Sadly, they all died of unknown circumstances, leaving Knuckles as the only echidna left to protect the Master Emerald.
