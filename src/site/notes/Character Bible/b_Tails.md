Tails didn’t change much, but now, his super form has a different design. Tails will have 4 tails, silver fur, and his hair tuff will be floating upwards like Super Sonic does.

**Backstory:**

Tails was born in Chaos Island, near Christmas Island, and was affected by the Chaos energy. His potency with Chaos energy was enough for him to be born with 2 tails without huge setbacks, but it’s his genius that is unparalleled between his peers. After saving his homeland from the Battle Kukku Empire, Tails moved out to Westside Island to find an explanation to its legend of being a moving island due to the Chaos Emeralds, he was made fun of by Westsiders because of his two tails, until he met Sonic and the two became best friends.
