# The intelligent beings of Earth

The Earth already had life in it when the Ancients crashed in Starfall Islands, which is located in Oceania. The appearance of a second Gem of Life mutated the beings of Oceania into what is now known as Mobians. Meanwhile, the Master Emerald started evolving primate beings into what will be known as the Homo family, which is going to be extinct in a few million years, with the only remaining species of it being the Homo sapiens, thanks to their 5 fingers and extremely high intelligence and stamina.
