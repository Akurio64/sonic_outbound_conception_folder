# The Echidnas

Thousands of years ago, there were multiple intelligent Mobians in Earth, but only one of them stood above all: the Echidnas. The Echidnas were a bunch of ruffians who pillaged other tribes nonstop, until that a figure known as Grandma united the Echidnas under peace. The Echidnas did not enjoy this idea, so when this figure died, her son, Pachacamac, turned the civilization into a warmongering empire, the first Mobian one. It met its end when the Echidnas tried to steal the Master Emerald and killed the neighboring Chao, angering Chaos, the least devolved of the Chao, as it killed all the Echidnas fighting. Pachacamac's daughter, Tikal, managed to save the world from destruction by sealing herself and Chaos inside the Master Emerald. 

After this tragedy, the remaining Echidnas swore to guard the Master Emerald to prevent such a tragedy to happen again by using it to rise up a huge piece of land up in the sky, which will be known as Angel Island. These Echidnas started writing about what happened that day and over the years, they started getting mutated with the Master Emerald, these Echidnas gained affinity with the power of the Chaos and Master Emerald. Sadly, most of them died out due to a epidemic a few years ago, with only Knuckles remaining.
