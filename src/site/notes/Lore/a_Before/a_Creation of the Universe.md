# The Creation of the Universe

It all started with the Big Bang, but who started it? The creator of the universe is debated by many people even today. It is unknown if the universe is the result of a all-powerful being or the result of randomness. The origin of life though, is something known.

Sentient life is created by Gems of Life, stones of unlimited power able to mutate primordial matter into living beings. The more time a sentient lifeform is subjected to the power of a Gem of Life, the more sapient and powerful it becomes. 

Gems of Life come from a divine being called The Beginning who has the unlimited power of creation. It travels the universe to send Gems of Life. The Beginning sees the universe as desolate and believes it must share its intelligence and knowledge to the universe, by creating sapient lifeforms. The Beginning exists in unison with an opposite being called the End. The End destroys worlds filled with sapient life to "free them from their suffering". It sees itself as a high authority and considers the Beginning to be deplorable. The countless lives that died under the power of the End have been destroyed for a reason, to ensure that they do not become so powerful they start terrorizing other lifeforms, as with high intelligence, comes selfishness.
