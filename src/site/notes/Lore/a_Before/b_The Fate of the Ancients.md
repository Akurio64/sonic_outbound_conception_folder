# The Fate of the Ancients

Long before recorded history, there was a highly intelligent civilization known as the Ancients who lived in a planet far away from ours. The five Ancient tribes kept fighting against each other, causing destruction all over their solar system, as they just started colonizing it. In the eyes of the End, they were too dangerous to keep alive, so it went and destroyed their home planet. 

The remaining Ancients sought refuge to our own planet, bringing their Gems of Life with them, but as their Gems reacted to the Master Emerald, our Gem of Life, their spaceship crashed on a island that will later be known as Starfall Islands. However, their settlement on the islands was short-lived because the End followed them. The Ancients managed to seal away the End on one of their Titan machines.

The remaining Ancients died out and their souls inhabited statues, although, some Ancients migrated to the area of the Master Emerald and started guarding their Gems and ours. The power of another Gem of Life eventually devolved the Ancients into less smart beings called Chao, but they will always remember to defend the Gems of Life. The Ancients' Gems of Life came to be known as the Chaos Emeralds.
